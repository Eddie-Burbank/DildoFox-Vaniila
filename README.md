<h4>
  US Department of Defense Approved
</h4>
<br>
<p>
  Dildofox employs all the configurations found in the US DoD Firefox GPO and STIG base-lines
  Plus hundreds more on top to secure your private browsing experience.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>
  Ever-Changing Browser Fingerprint
</h4>
<br>
<p>
  Dildofox takes a different approach than the TOR Browser where the practice is to blend in,
  instead, based on Arkenfox's guidelines, Dildofox's configuration is constantly spoofing<br>
  the browser's fingerprint values, making you appear as a different user each site you visit.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>
  Pre-Installed Extensions
</h4>
<br>
<p>
  A selection of extensions come pre installed with Dildofox, all targeted toward the
  spoofing of the browser fingerprint and the IP address, plus a few other handy tools.
  This reduces the need to visit the MozApps store which helps reduce fingerprinting further.

<h4>
  Privacy Focused Search Engines
</h4>
<br>
<p>
  Search Engines such as DuckDuckGo, StartPage and more have been added to Dildofox,
  to ensure that your searches are not logged and remain private. An .onion Search Engine
  is also included in the form of Tory, which allows you to search the Deep-Web with a single click!
  Search Engines such as Google and Bing have been removed to encourage you
  to use more privacy focused options and to help break through the censorship barrier.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>
  Helping you bypass Mass-Surveillance
</h4>
<br>
<p>
  In a world where someone would watch you go to the toilet if they could, Dildofox helps
  you regain some privacy in a world where most have none. Combined with other privacy-based
  techniques such as VPN's, MAC Spoofers and Scripts to clear database and other files,
  Dildofox has the potential to be a powerful tool in the Freedom Fighting Trolls arsenal.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>
  Commited to Fighting the Good Fight
</h4>
<br>
<p> 
  Dildofox was built to empower freedom fighting individuals who want to rise above mass censorship
  and surveillance imposed on us by the establishment. I believe everyone has a right to privacy and noone
  should be silenced for speaking the truth and that all factual information should be readily available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dildofox is designed to be a tool that gives individuals the right to speak their mind and avoid nasty
  message board bans for simply speaking truth or calling out naysayers. As an advocate for truth and justice,
  I believe that if used right, Dildofox has the potential to help people be a force for good.
